#! /bin/sed -f
#
# This SED script is a filter to Yorick Makefile.  The following
# operations are performed:
#   - Trailing spaces are removed.
#   - Tabulations are left unchanged (this is intended for Makefiles).
#   - Unix-like end of line markers are used (LF).
#   - Macros like Y_HOME which are overwritten by 'yorick -batch make.i' are
#     cleared.
#
# Replace CRLF (\r\n = \x0d\x0a) by a LF (the LF is preserved by sed and is after the
# end-of-line $ marker):
s/\x0d$//
#
# Remove trailing spaces:
s/  *$//
#
# Replace single CR (\r = \x0d) preceded by any number of spaces by a LF (\n = \x0a):
s/ *\x0d/\x0a/g
#
# Cleanup Yorick macros:
s/^\( *Y_\(MAKEDIR\|EXE\(\|_PKGS\|_HOME\|_SITE\)\|HOME_PKG\) *=\).*/\1/
