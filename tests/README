* Unconstrained minimization test suite from the MINPACK-1 project.
  These tests are described in references [1] and [2] ("MGH" stands
  for "Moré, Garbow and Hillstrom" the authors of the original FORTRAN
  tests).

   - mgh-port.c, mgh-port.h
             Routines for unconstrained optimization tests ported in
             C.  This was needed for people not having a FORTRAN
             compiler and as a preliminary step to make the tests
             available in Java.

   - mgh-tests.c
             This program checks whether the C version (in mgh-port.c)
             gives the same results as the original FORTRAN routines.
             To run these tests, the original FORTRAN routines (in
             directory ../orig/mgh) must be available.

   - mgh-wrappers.c, mgh-wrappers.h
             Wrapper functions to make the FORTRAN routines (in
             directory ../orig/mgh) easy to call from C test codes.
